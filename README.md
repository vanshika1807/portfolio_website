# 🌐 Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with **React + Vite**.  
It showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- ⚛️ **React** – UI library for building interactive components  
- ⚡ **Vite** – Fast development and build tool  
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS / Custom CSS** – For styling (if you used it)  
- 🔗 **React Router** – For smooth navigation (if used)  
- 🖼️ **React Icons** – For beautiful icons  

## ✨ Features
- 🏠 Clean and modern UI  
- 💼 Projects showcase with live demos and source code  
- 📱 Fully responsive design (works on all devices)  
- 🌐 Custom domain setup with GitHub Pages  

## 🌍 Live Demo

### ✅ Want me to make it **more creative (with badges, GitHub stats, and screenshots)**?  
I can enhance it with **shields.io badges, a preview image, and a better design** if you'd like! Shall I proceed?
